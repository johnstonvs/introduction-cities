		<h1>Cities Lived In</h1>

		<p>Was raised in Phoenix. Joined the Airforce and they sent me to Minot AFB. I bought a house in Lansford.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Phoenix<br><span>I grew up there.</span></li>
			<li>Minot<br><span>Military sent me there.</span></li>
			<li>Lansford<br><span>Bought a house there.</span></li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Cities to Visit</h1>

		<p>I'd mostly just like to scope these places out to see if they're a good spot to live. Besides New Orleans, I just want to visit there while I'm doing my SAC course in Louisiana.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Austin</strong><br><span>Joe Rogan says it's a nice place.</span></li>
			<li><em>New Orleans</em><br><span>I'll be close when in Louisiana for SAC.</span></li>
			<li><strong>Flagstaff</strong><br><span>Spent time as a kid there, it's pretty.</span></li>
		</ol>
