		<h1>Cities Lived In</h1>

		<p>Was raised in Phoenix. Joined the Airforce and they sent me to Minot AFB. I bought a house in Lansford.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Phoenix</li>
			<li>Minot</li>
			<li>Lansford</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Cities to Visit</h1>

		<p>I'd mostly just like to scope these places out to see if they're a good spot to live. Besides New Orleans, I just want to visit there while I'm doing my SAC course in Louisiana.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Austin</li>
			<li>New Orleans</li>
			<li>Flagstaff</li>
